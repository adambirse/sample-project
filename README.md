# sample-project
Sample getting started project for Gradle, Docker and Spring boot.  This project is intended to be a starter for 10 for anyone looking to use the following technologies:

- Gradle
- Spring boot
- Docker

It has been created based on experience of previous projects and try's to build on best practice learnt.  I aim to extend this project to cover areas such as:

- Unit and Integration testing
- Selenium testing
- Code coverage
- Non java/spring applications
- Anything else that might be useful for those starting a new project.

Please feel free to get in touch and to make contributions.
